# Control Statements

1. **Factorial of a Given Number**
   - Write a C Program to find the factorial of a given number. User has to input the number at runtime.

2. **Sum of Digits**
   - Write a C Program to find the sum of digits of a given number.

3. **Reverse Digits**
   - Write a C Program to reverse the digits of a given number.

4. **Convert Character Case**
   - Write a C Program to convert a character. If it is lower, convert it to upper, and if it is upper, convert it to lower character.

5. **Multiplication Tables**
   - Write a C Program to print multiplication tables from 10 to 20.

6. **First 100 Prime Numbers**
   - Write a C Program to print the first 100 prime numbers.

7. **Armstrong Numbers**
   - Write a C Program to print Armstrong Numbers between 1 to 500.

8. **Binary of a Number**
   - Write a C Program to print the binary of a given number (positive or negative).

9. **Reverse Bits**
   - Write a C Program to reverse the bits of a given number.

10. **Calculator**
    - Write a C Program to implement a Calculator using switch.

11. **Complement and Representations**
    - Write a C Program to find the complement of a given number and then print its binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal values. Note: number can be either positive or negative. And observe the result satisfying its formula or not.
        - Formula: 1's complement of (x) = -(x + 1)

12. **2's Complement and Representations**
    - Write a C Program to find the 2's complement of a given number and then print its binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal values. Note: number can be either positive or negative. And observe the result satisfying its formula or not.
        - Formula: 2's complement of (x) = -(x)

13. **Power without pow() Function**
    - Write a C Program to find the power of a given number without using pow() function.

14. **Complement of a Particular Bit**
    - Write a C Program to find the complement of a particular bit. User has to input the position number at runtime.

15. **Palindrome Numbers**
    - Write a C Program to print palindrome numbers between 1 to 1000. (Palindrome numbers are those which are equal to their reverse.)

16. **Fibonacci Series**
    - Write a C Program to print Fibonacci series between 0 to 50.

17. **Power of 2**
    - Write a C Program to find if the given number is a power of 2 or not.

18. **Biggest Number of Three Variables**
    - Write a C Program to find out the biggest number of three variables using if-else ladder and ternary operator.

19. **Month in Words**
    - Accept a month in digit from the user. Display the month in words. If the number is not between 1 and 12, display the message "Invalid Month". (Use 'switch')

20. **Perfect Number**
    - Write a C Program to find if the given number is a perfect number or not.
      Note: Perfect number means the sum of its divisors except that number is equivalent to the same number.
      Example: If input number = 6.
               Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.
               Sum = 1 + 2 + 3
               Sum = 6. So here 6 is a perfect number.
