# Arrays

1) Write a C program to input 10 numbers through the keyboard into an array and
     display the results of the addition of even numbers and the product of odd numbers.

2) Write a C program to input 10 numbers through the keyboard into an array and find the 
     the biggest and smallest number in an Unsorted array without using any Sorting Technique.

3) Write a C program to input 10 numbers through the keyboard and find the number
     of prime numbers count, store  them into a separate array, and display it.

4)  Write a C program to find out the second largest and second smallest elements of an
      unsorted array without using any Sorting Technique.

5) Write a C program to reverse  the elements of a given array.

6) Write a C program to delete an element at a desired position from an array.

7) Write a C program to insert an element at a desired position in an array. 

 For Example if 'A' is to be stored at '0' position then,

8) Write a C program that deletes the duplicate elements of an array.

9) Write a C program to find the duplicate elements of a given array and find the count of
     duplicated elements.
 
     Ex: if  int a[] = {0,3,1,0,5,1,2,0,4,5}

      output : -
      The duplicate elements present in an array 
       0  -- 3 times
       1  -- 2 times
       5  -- 2 times 

10) Write a program to print the non repeated numbers of  a given array.
        Ex : if   int a[] = {0,3,1,0,5,1,2,0,4,5}

                Output :  3, 2, 4

11) Write a program to copy the elements of one array into another array without duplicate
       items as a first slot, and store duplicate elements as a second slot.
  
     Ex:   source array           {10,2,4,5,2,1,3,4,6,5,8,9,2}

             destination arrays  {10,2,4,5,1,3,6,8,9} ,   { 2,2,4,5} 
                                                     first slot               second slot

       Take two different arrays for the first and second slots. 

12) Write a C program to evaluate the following series. The series contains the sum of
       squares of numbers from 1 to 'n'. Store the result of each term in an array. Calculate 
       the value of  ' S '  using an array.
 
        S = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + ------ n^2
           =    [ 1, 4, 9, 16, -------- n^2 ]

      Suppose n = 4,

      then  S =  1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2;
               S = 1+4+9+16;  
               S  =  30.


13)	Write a C program to implement the stack using arrays.
