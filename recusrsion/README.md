# Recursion Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)	Write a recursive function to find the factorial of a given number..

2)	Write a recursive function to print the 'n'  fibonacci series numbers.

3)	Write a recursive function to find the sum of digits of a given number.

4)	Write a recursive function to revese the given number.

5)	Write a recursive function to that displays all the proper divisors of a given number
	 exept that and returns their sum.
	 Ex: 1,3,5,9,15 & 45 are the proper divisors of 45.
	        sum = 1+3+5+9+15
		      = 33

     6) Write a recursive function that displays a positive integer in words. For ex: if the
          integer is 3412 then it is displayed as three four one two.

7)	Write a recursive function to print first 100 prime numbers.

8)	Write a recursive function to print the palindrome numbers in a given numbers.

      9)  A number is perfect if the sum of all its positive proper divisors is equal to the
           number. For example 28 is a perfect number since 28 = 1+2+4+14. Write a 
           recursive function that finds whether a number is perfect or not.

     10) Write a recursive function to find the largest element in a given Unsorted array.

     11) Write a recursive function to reverse the bits of a given number.
 
12)	Write a recursive function to revese the elements of a given array.

 
13) Write a recursive function to revese the string. (Note : not just reverse printing
        charecter by charecter)
