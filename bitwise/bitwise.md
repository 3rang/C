# Bitwise Operators

---

1. Write a program for the following:
   - a) Set a bit
   - b) Clear a bit
   - c) Toggle a bit

2. WAP to find whether a given number is even or odd using bitwise operators.

3. WAP to find whether a given number is positive or negative using bitwise operators.

4. WAP to swap two numbers using bitwise operators.

5. WAP to determine whether a given number is a power of 2 or not.

6. WAP to check whether a given number is divisible by 8 or not using bitwise operators.

7. Write a program to rotate the bits. Input the number of rotations at runtime.
    - Example:
      - Binary: 10000000000000000000000000001011
      - Rotations: Suppose 3 times right, then
        Result: 01110000000000000000000000000001

      - Binary: 10000000000000000000000000001011
      - Rotations: Suppose 4 times left, then
        Result: 00000000000000000000000010111000

8. Convert the characters Upper to Lower and Lower to Upper using bitwise operators.

9. Write a program to reverse the bits of a given number.
    - Note: Not just reverse printing.

10. Write a one-liner to compare two numbers equal or not using bitwise operators.

11. Write a program to print the float binary formation using char *ptr.

12. Write a program to swap the adjacent bytes of a given 4-digit hexadecimal number.
    - Example:
      - Given number = 0x1234;
      - After swap: 0x3412;

13. Write a program to delete a number of bits from a particular position in a given number. Input the number of bits at runtime.
    - Example:
      - Suppose num = 100;
      - Its Binary is 00000000000000000000000001100100
      - Delete 2 bits from the 4th position
      - Then result is 00000000000000000000000000011100

14. Write a program for swapping first and last nibbles in a given integer.
    - Example:
      - Suppose num = 10
      - Its Binary is 0000000000000000000000000001010
      - After swap: 1010000000000000000000000000000

15. Write a logic to extract P bits from position N in an integer M.

16. Write a macro to clear a bit at position N in an integer M.

17. There are 48 bits stored in an array of character buffer and store them into 2 integer variables.
