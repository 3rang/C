# String

This repository contains various string manipulation programs written in C. Each program focuses on a different aspect of string handling, including operations like finding string length, copying strings, counting characters, and more.

## Programs List

1. **String Length Using Pointer**
   - Write a program to find string length using a pointer.

2. **Copy String**
   - Write a one-line code to copy a string into another buffer.

3. **Character Frequency**
   - Write a program to find the number of times a character is found in a given string.

4. **Find Vowels**
   - Write a program to find vowels in a given string.

5. **String Comparison Without `strcmp`**
   - Write a program to compare two strings without using the `strcmp` function.

6. **String Reversal**
   - Write a program to reverse the string using loops and recursion.

7. **Palindrome Check**
   - Write a program to check if the given strings are palindromes or not.
     - **Note:** Palindrome words read the same forwards and backwards (e.g., madam, level, radar, stats).

8. **Word Count**
   - Write a program to find the number of words in a given string line.
     - **Note:** The user inputs the string line at runtime.

9. **Delete Character**
   - Write a program to delete a desired character in a given string.
     - **Example:**
       - Input: `embedded`
       - Character: `d`
       - Output: `embee`

10. **Remove Consecutive Spaces**
    - Write a program to remove consecutive spaces in a given string line.
      - **Example:**
        - Input: `This    is   a  test`
        - Output: `This is a test`

11. **Delete Duplicate Characters**
    - Write a program to delete duplicate characters in a given string.
      - **Example:**
        - Input: `vecteeovvorr`
        - Output: `vector`

12. **Count Duplicate Characters**
    - Write a program to print the count of duplicate characters in a given string.
      - **Example:**
        - Input: `hrithik roshan`
        - Output:
          ```
          Letter   -------  Count
          h        -------      3
          r        -------      2
          i        -------      2
          ```

13. **Character Type Count**
    - Write a program to find the count of lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters, and digits in a given string.

14. **Toggle Case**
    - Write a program to convert characters from upper to lower case and vice versa in a given string.

15. **Sort String**
    - Write a program to sort a given string in ascending order.

16. **Interleave Strings**
    - Write a program to accept two strings from the user and interleave them into a destination array.
      - **Example:**
        - First String: `abcdefg`
        - Second String: `1234`
        - Destination String: `a1b2c3d4efg`

17. **Substring Frequency**
    - Write a program to find the number of times a substring is found in a given string.

18. **Reverse Words**
    - Write a program to reverse the words in a given string line.
      - **Example:**
        - Input: `I am a good boy`
        - Output: `I ma a doog yob`

19. **Reverse Word Order**
    - Write a program to replace the words in reverse order in a given string line.
      - **Example:**
        - Input: `world changed your thoughts`
        - Output: `thoughts your changed world`

20. **Sort Strings by Length**
    - Write a program to declare an array of string pointers, input the strings from stdin into the array, and sort them in ascending order according to string length.
      - **Note:** Use dynamic memory allocation (DMA).

21. **Replace Word**
    - Write a program to read two strings through the keyboard and replace a word in the second string with the first string.
      - **Example:**
        - Input:
          ```
          First String: `Tomorrow`
          Second String: `Today is Sunday`
          Replace word: `Today`
          ```
        - Output: `Tomorrow is Sunday`

22. **Anagram Check**
    - Write a program to check if the given strings are anagrams.
      - **Note:** An anagram is a rearrangement of the letters of one word or phrase to form another word or phrase. Both strings are anagrams if they contain the same elements the same number of times in any order, ignoring non-alphabet characters.
      - **Example:**
        - `Osama bin laden` and `Old man in a base`
        - `study` and `dus%@ty123` (ignoring special characters and digits)

23. **Decrypt String**
    - Write a program for decrypting an encrypted string line with respect to a given key number.
      - **Example:**
        - Input String: `Expcet Porblmes adn eat thef mor rbeafkast`
        - Key: 4
        - Output: `Expect Problems and eat them for breakfast`
